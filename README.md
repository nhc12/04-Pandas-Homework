# 04-Pandas-Homework
* For the first section, to join the Whale Returns, Algorithmic Returns, and the S&P TSX 60 Returns into a single DataFrame with columns for each portfolio's returns, cleaned each set of data (e.g. remove null values, indexed date, removed dollar signs) and runned **concat**.
* For the second part of the excercise, took as portfolio: Pfizer, Apple and BP in FY2018 from Google Finance in order to join with the data frame of the first part of the excercise
* In both cases "Algo 1" portfolio outperformed both the market (S&P TSX 60), the whales portfolios and the new portfolio created
* Took additional inspiration from the below sources:

  * https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.ewm.html
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29432629/plot-correlation-matrix-using-pandas
* I will appreciate your feedback on how to perform this excercise, this is a very new experience for me (I dont have any coding background).
